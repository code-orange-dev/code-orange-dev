# üü† Code Orange Dev School

Bitcoin lacks developers and node runners in Asia. **Code Orange** fixes this by training regular developers and bitcoiners into builders who strengthen Bitcoin‚Äôs network through advanced self-custody, node running and community leadership.

## **What We Do**

- **Advanced Bitcoin Dev Education**: 8-week *Decoding Bitcoin* study cohorts and 5-week *Sovereign Bitcoiner* crash courses.
- **Workshops**: Hands-on in-person workshops covering node-running, mining, multisig, private eCash payments, fedimint, Nostr and more to keep the network decentralised.  
- **Community Hubs**: Partner with Bitcoin House Bali, Bitcoin Learning Centers, and bitcoin community hubs to host workshops in Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, English and Mandarin.  
- **Talent Scouting**: Train developers with resources from Chaincode Labs, base58, ‚ÇøTrust/Qala and Vinteum, guiding graduates to contribute to Bitcoin Core, Lightning, Fedimint, etc.
- **Train-the-Trainer**: Empower technical community leaders at bitcoin hubs to replicate Code Orange workshops acorss Asia by having regular train-the-trainer sessions.
- **"Sovereign Bitcoiner" packs**: Sending parcels to community hubs with Tshirts, SeedSigners, stickers and workshop guides to empower community leaders with technical know-how on running bitcoiner workshops.
- **Local Payments**: Tackle regional challenges with tools like Fedi‚Äôs federated mints, Koral and PlebQR for smoother payments.
